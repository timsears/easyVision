A minimal config.nix is in nix/config.nix.easyVision.
Install it with

~~~
cp nix/config.nix.easyVision ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix
~~~

(A config.nix file may contain many other settings if you have
multiple projects going or are using nix in your daily work. To see
the settings in context you can take a look at my current config.nix
